A map drawn in ash

apples still rotting in the grass

A handwoven blanket with moth-holes

The scent of iron and wild violets lingering in a ruined house

Someone eating an orange under fluorescent lights

The flicker of a dying phone screen lighting a face

The sound of a zipper in a quiet room

A stranger‚Äôs reflection in your sunglasses

Roadside billboards overgrown with luminous moss

A child‚Äôs toy floating through orbit like space debris

Water towers converted into shrines

Receipts printed with unreadable glyphs

The sound of bees inside a cathedral

A coat pocket filled with seeds

An unfinished sketch found under the wallpaper

Rain dripping through a chandelier

A candle flickering inside a vending machine

A calendar with every date crossed out in red

A jug of water sweating in the sun on a wooden table

Puddles trembling as thunder rolls far away

A man asleep in a field of sunflowers, coat over his face

The taste of copper after biting your tongue in a dream

Deserted
